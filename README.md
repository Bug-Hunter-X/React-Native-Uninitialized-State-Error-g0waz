This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: attempting to access state before it has been initialized. The `UninitializedState.js` file contains the buggy code, which results in an error because the `count` state is accessed before the component has mounted and the state has been set. The `UninitializedStateSolution.js` file shows how to resolve this issue using the `useState` hook's default value or conditional rendering.
